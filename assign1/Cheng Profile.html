            <div class="member-description">I am Lim Cheng Yi, like a lot of people i born and live in Kuching, Sarawak. The history of Sarawak can go back In 1839, James Brooke, a British explorer, first arrived in Sarawak. Sarawak was later governed by the Brooke family between 1841 and 1946, and James Brooke became the first "White Raja" of the Sarawak. During World War II, it was occupied by the Japanese for three years before the Japanese was finally defeated in 2 September 1945. The Sarawak are also famous for it's wildlife centre as it was the home to endangered species such as Rhinoceros hornbill, orang utans and other local flora and fauna. Kuching city of Sarawak is also known as the city of Cat and Cat statue are known to be a popular tourist spot. Lastly, let us not forget about the food here i personally liked the Laksa, Kolo mee, Kueh chap here, they are the regular order i would get whenther i visit a cafe. </div>
