            <p>As a means to research and record the world's plant biodiversity, botanists, taxonomists, naturalists, and physicians have painstakingly gathered herbarium specimens over the ages.</p>
            <p>These specimens are conserved by pressing, drying, and mounting them on sheets of paper. Each specimen has a label with pertinent information including the scientific name, place of origin, date of collection, and name of the institution that houses it.</p>
