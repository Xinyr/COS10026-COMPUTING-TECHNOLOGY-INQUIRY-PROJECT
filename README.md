Use this repository to store your assignment files

Please create a branch with your name by clicking the branch icon at the top.

**IMPORTANT:** always create a pull request FROM main into your branch, BEFORE pushing your changes to main. It is also important to always check if you are using main or your branch.

When we complete an assigment, we will consolidate all the files into the main branch, and use the Release function to create a zip file for future use.

Contact me if you have other suggestions on standardizing our formatting, or if you need help in using Github.
