Use this repository to store your assignment files

For consistency, please include your initials in the filename 
  For example: my initials are F.S. (Frederick Sii), therefore I should name my file overview_FS.html

When we complete an assigment, we will consolidate all the files into the folder /assignment#-final/

Contact me if you have other suggestions on standardizing our formatting.
